## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Product Retail Sales
### Objective

The goal of this project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover meaningful business insights, identify trends, detect anomalies, and understand relationships between variables.
### Data set : [Uploading Product_retail_sales.csvâ€¦]()

## Tools & Libraries

- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook for analysis

- PDF report generation

### Steps Performed

#### 1) Data Understanding & Cleaning

- Loaded the dataset and examined its structure using .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts().

- Checked for missing values and visualized them with a missingness map.

- Identified data types (numeric vs categorical) and prepared for further analysis.

#### 2) Descriptive Statistics

- Generated statistical summaries (mean, median, std, min, max, skewness).

- Reviewed categorical distributions and top category counts.

#### 3) Data Visualization

- Histograms â†’ Distribution of numeric variables.

- Boxplots â†’ Detection of outliers.

- Bar charts â†’ Category-level frequency distributions.

- Correlation Heatmap â†’ Relationships between numeric features.

- Scatter Matrix â†’ Multi-variable relationships.

#### 4) Groupby & Aggregation Analysis

- Used .groupby() with count, mean, and sum to uncover category-level insights.

- Compared top-performing categories (e.g., sales, revenue).

#### 5) Outlier & Skewness Detection

- Measured skewness of numeric columns.

- Applied log transformations for highly skewed variables to normalize distributions.

#### 6) Deliverables

- ðŸ““ Jupyter Notebook â†’ Full reproducible analysis with code and visualizations.

- ðŸ“‘ PDF Report â†’ Summary of findings, key charts, and insights.
